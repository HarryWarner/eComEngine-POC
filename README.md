# eComEngine
e-commerce website development engine

Built on an Apache Webserver which handles php, and hosts phpmyadmin to handle mysql requests.

This can all be configured in XAMPP for running locally on your machine.

This project is something I started working on between finishing up at my previous job, and starting a new position. I plan to continually add to this over time. At present, it's very basic, but the end goal is to develop an e-commerce engine which has a built in CMS accessible to the sites administrator. I want this to be quick and easy to deploy, and populate, which would allow a user to quickly deploy an e-commerce website with stripe integration for payment processing, along side a bunch of other optional add-ons, such as webhooks, and many more. 

This is in the very early stages of development
